singly linked list
things to note.
this type of list can only be navigated forward. this list is made up of nodes which has 2 parts. the data and the link. the node is declared in structure that call on to itself.

declaring a node or creating a node.
struct node
{
    int data: //here one can put any data type. 
    struct node *link. //this is the where the pointer of the link will be saved. 
}
to begin a link, a pointer head pointer has to be decleared so as to save the pointer of the first node, thereafter, the list can be linked and accessed.
